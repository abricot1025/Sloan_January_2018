\section{To-do list} \label{to-do}

This Section enumerates the remaining main tasks to be done to obtain a working software. \\

The first task to accomplish is, as described in Section \ref{set_target_1}, the correction on the target's position for each actuator depending on the fiber used. This was the main task of this project, however I personally searched in the wrong direction and discovered the mistake too late. \\

Another point to set is on the collision-free update for the Sloan project, especially on the behaviour of fiducial tools on the DNF for its actuator's neighbour. Moreover, the change in the DNF parameters have to be tested so no collision occurs during any process, while verifying that the number of deadlocks stays low.\\ 

Some improvements can me made but are not essential for the operation of the software. Indeed, the convergence rate was still improvable as on the last version. In the same way, the prioritisation can be still improved, to be sure a priority target will be surveyed. \\

The last category of tasks are the improvement of the code in the program: indeed, there is still some feature only used for the MOONS project remaining on the Sloan version. This can slow down the program, lead to mistakes and above all will decrease the understanding of the code.
